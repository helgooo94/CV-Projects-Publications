## PROJECTS
* **DiSensity – Virtual Reality for Diversity Awareness** – DiSensity develops immersive VR scenarios that let participants experience everyday discrimination from multiple perspectives. The goal is to foster empathy and spark critical reflection.
* **MoViAs – Emotion-Enriched Voice Assistants** – MoViAs studies how speech assistants can pick up on and express emotions. By fusing prosody analysis, affective dialogue models, and user studies, the project seeks to make human-assistant conversations feel more natural
* **DigiFall – Transdisciplinary Self-Assessment** – DigiFall creates a digital self-assessment framework for both educational and healthcare settings. Learners, patients, and professionals receive feedback on competencies and well-being, enabling personalized learning paths and preventive interventions.
* **RuhrBots – Citizen-Centric Social Robots** – RuhrBots explores how friendly, easy-to-use robots can improve public services across Ruhr metropolitan city halls. Prototypes greet visitors, guide them through administrative processes, and collect feedback—always with data privacy and accessibility in mind.
* **vGather2Learn – Collaborative Video-Based Learning** – vGather2Learn turns passive video lectures into active group experiences. Integrated chat, shared annotations, and AI-powered prompts help learners co-construct knowledge and keep engagement high, whether in the classroom or fully online.
* **Transferhub “Digitalization & Circular Economy” (Prosperkolleg)** – The Transferhub strengthens knowledge exchange between academia and industry to accelerate the twin transition—digitalization and sustainability—across the northern Ruhr region. By mentoring companies on circular business models, data-driven resource loops, and startup creation, the hub showcases how former coal-mining cities can become hotspots for green innovation.

## Awards
